<p>The one, the <em>only</em>, the creamy chicken noodle soup. This guy is the absolute king of our winter recipe set list. We have it once every two weeks or so every winter because it's silky, creamy, and simple to make. If this sounds like an advertisement, it's because it is. I will advertise this guy every day of the week.</p>
<p>The recipe itself is pretty simple! I adapted it from somewhere, added vegetables and made the chicken from fresh chicken breasts, then adjusted the timing. Even then, it really is as simple as adding the noodles, adding the veggies, then stir in the rest! Ten out of ten!</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, diced</li>
        <li>2 tsp garlic salt</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>8 cups water</li>
        <li>8 tsp chicken bouillon</li>
        <li>3-4 medium carrots, sliced</li>
        <li>1 white onion, diced</li>
        <li>4 stalks of celery, sliced</li>
        <li>8 oz sour cream</li>
        <li>2 10.5 oz cans of condensed cream of chicken soup</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium high heat.</li>
        <li>Season the diced chicken breasts with garlic salt and add to the skillet. Saute until all the liquid had evaporated the chicken pieces have formed a brown crust.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat the water and chicken bouillon in a large pot until boiling.</li>
        <li>Add the egg noodles. After 3 minutes, add the vegetables. Cook for an additional 7 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Take soup off of heat. Add in the chicken and the cream of chicken soup.</li>
        <li>Add in the sour cream, stirring in a quarter at a time until all the sour cream is mixed in.</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately.</li>
