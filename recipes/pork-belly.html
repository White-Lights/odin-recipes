<h1>Soy Sauce Braised Pork Belly (Kakuni)</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This recipe is stolen straight from Just One Cookbook, a Japanese cooking website. It was the first thing I made with my pressure cooker. It's sweet because of the sugar, deep with umami flavor, and the pork belly just melts in your mouth. I keep writing these like advertisements, but I love talking about my favorite foods to cook. The only change I made personally is making soy eggs separately - I didn't think they turned out as well in the pressure cooker.</p>
<p>The pork belly itself is quite simple to make. After cutting it into cubes, you brown it in the bottom of the pot (I used an Instant Pot, but there's no reason you can't do this with any type of pressure cooker), cover it with water, and let the pressure cook the pork. Add the braising ingredients - a sugar soy recipe that creates a sweet and umami taste - and let it cook a little longer. It's defintiely not a week night recipe because the pressure cooker can take some time, but it <em>is</em> a very hands-off recipe to cook, making it good if you're busy cleaning or working on something else as you cook. I eat it with rice and king oyster mushrooms cooked in butter and soy sauce, but it's a simple, effective combination of flavors so it can be served with any variety of side dishes.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Pork Belly</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 green onions or scallions, sliced</li>
        <li>1 knob of ginger about 1 inch long, peeled and sliced</li>
        <li>1 tbsp canola oil</li>
        <li>3 lbs of pork belly, cut into 1 inch cubes</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Braising Liquid</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>1/2 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 cup mirin</li>
        <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sake</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the ingredients. Separate the green of the scallions from the white, and slice the green parts. Discard or put aside the white parts for another recipe. Peel and slice the ginger. Cut the pork belly into cubes.</li>
        <li>Turn on the heat for the pressure cooker (the stove on medium-high for stove top pressure cookers, or the saute function for an Instant Pot) and add the oil. When hot, add the pork belly cubes one layer at a time, working in batches, until all pieces are browned.</li>
        <li>One all the meet is browned, pour in enough water to just cover the meet. Add the sliced green onions and the ginger. Cover and lock the lid, turning the steam valve to sealed. Cook on high pressure for 30-35 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once the pressure is released (pressure can release manually or naturally), unlock the lid, discard the onions and ginger, and drain the cooking water from the pot.</li>
        <li>Add the pork belly back into the pressure cooker and turn on the heat again. Add the ingredients for the braising liquid - the water, soy sauce, sugar, mirin, and sake - and bring to a boil. Boil for approximately 30 seconds, until the alcohol has cooked off.</li>
        <li>Cook on low pressure for 15-20 minutes. Optionally, turn on the heat once more and bring to a simmer to reduce the braising liquid into a sauce.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately with rice.</li>
    </ol>
