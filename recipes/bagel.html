<h2 class="headers">Description</h2>
<p>This is one of my more indulgent recipes, mostly because it features both ham and bacon whereas most sandwiches only feature one or the other. But the crisp of the bacon and fullness of the ham make this an amazing treat after a long day (we are a breakfast-for-dinner household and we cannot be stopped). Add bagel sauce, a fried egg, gouda cheese, and any fixins you so please, this sandwich can keep someone full for a day and change. It's in fact one of the few dishes that I don't insist on making sides with (I just make a friut cup sometimes).</p>
<p>Making it is quite simple. Cooking the egg and the bacon, toasting the bagel, putting together the ingredients. It's probably, although it takes maybe 20 minutes to prep everything, a little more effort than necessary, but I like to go the extra mile for my wife's favorite foods so I simply cannot and will not be shamed!</p>
<p>This recipe provides enough ingredients to make two sandwiches.</p>

<h2 class="headers">Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 bagels, sliced in half</li>
    <li>2 jumbo eggs</li>
    <li>2 slices of gouda cheese</li>
    <li>4 slices of bacon, cut in half</li>
    <li>2 slices of ham</li>
    <li>4 tbsp butter</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="headers">Bagel Sauce</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 tbsp mayonnaise</li>
    <li>1 tbsp mustard</li>
    <li>1 1/2 tsp steak sauce (A1 or Heinz 57 both work well)</li>
    <li>1 1/2 tsp lemon jucie</li>
    <li>1/8 tsp dried dill</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="headers">Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Prepare the bagel sauce in advance. Combine all the ingredients in a glass or ceramic bowl. Chill in the fridge for at least 1 hour before preparing the sandwiches, but at least 4 hours is ideal for all the flavors to combine.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.</li>
    <li>Cook the four slices of bacon until crispy using preferred method. Let drain on a plate lined with paper towels. Meanwhile, use 1 tbsp of butter to fry the eggs over medium heat in another pan.</li>
    <li>To toast the bagel halves, use a nonstick skillet. If using a large skillet that can hold two halves, add butter 1 tbsp at a time, but if using a smaller skillet to cook 1 half a time, add only half a tbsp at a time. Toast each bagel face-down in the butter for two to three minutes, until a brown crust has formed. Replenish butter as needed.</li>
    <li>Put together the bagel sandwiches. Stack one slice of ham, one egg, two slices of bacon, and one slice of gouda. Spread bagel sauce onto top half of bagel.</li>
    <li>Place the bagels on a wire rack, and put wire rack in oven for 3 minutes. This allows for the cheese to melt and all the ingredients to come to the same temperature. Serve immediately.</li>
